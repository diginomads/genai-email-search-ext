# Email Extension

According to a Canadian survey, people spend a total of 17 hours a week reading, responding and sending work emails both at work and at home. 

The search function in Gmail is robust, but it can be cumbersome to recall the operators and properly format dates. Using this extension a separate query box be available built ontop of existing gmail search functionality. GenAI will create the operators necessary for refineded searches.
